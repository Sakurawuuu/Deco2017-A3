# Timer Page
![Prototype(left) and Mockup(right](/img/Timerpage.png)
>In the initial design, the problem of function use was not considered and two timers were repeatedly made. In the improvement, the switches of the test in the list were added, and the switches were used to control the timer. And added the ability to customize the time.

# CONCLUSION
>All mobile versions have been adapted to the web version. In the above changes, I found that more consideration should be given to functional adaptation in the design. More small settings can be extended within each page.
